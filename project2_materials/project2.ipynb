Including visualizations of the data is strongly encouraged - all code and plots must also be described in the write up. Think carefully about whether each plot needs to be included in your final draft - your report should include figures but they should be as focused and impactful as possible.*\n\n*You should also split your data into training and testing sets, ideally before you look to much into the features and relationships with the target*\n\n*Additionally, this section should also implement and describe any preprocessing / feature engineering of the data. Specifically, this should be any code that you use to generate new columns in the data frame `d`.

You are strongly encouraged to explore many different modeling methods (e.g. linear regression, interaction terms, lasso, etc.) but you should not include a detailed narrative of all of these attempts. At most this section should mention the methods explored and why they were rejected - most of your effort should go into describing the model you are using and your process for tuning and validating it.*\n\n*For example if you considered a linear regression model, a polynomial regression, and a lasso model and ultimately settled on the linear regression approach then you should mention that other two approaches were tried but do not include any of the code or any in depth discussion of these models beyond why they were rejected. This section should then detail is the development of the linear regression model in terms of features used, interactions considered, and any additional tuning and validation which ultimately led to your final model.* \n\n*This section should also include the full implementation of your final model, including all necessary validation. As with figures, any included code must also be addressed in the text of the document.*\n\n*Finally, you should also provide comparison of your model with baseline model(s) on the test data but only briefly describe the baseline model(s) considered*","block_group":"5c4b38d773f3439c8b602e097a44a263"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"9253c78a6fa444f0a548664eda0fc678","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"# Discussion & Conclusions\n\n*In this section you should provide a general overview of your final model, its performance, and reliability. You should discuss what the implications of your model are in terms of the included features, predictive performance, and anything else you think is relevant.*\n\n*This should be written with a target audience of a government official or charity directy, who is understands the pressing challenges associated with ageining and dementia but may only have university level mathematics (not necessarily postgraduate statistics or machine learning). Your goal should be to highlight to this audience how your model can useful. You should also mention potential limitations of your model.*\n\n*Finally, you should include recommendations on potential lifestyle changes or governmental/societal interventions to reduce dementia risk.*\n\n*Keep in mind that a negative result, i.e. a model that does not work well predictively, that is well explained and justified in terms of why it failed will likely receive higher marks than a model with strong predictive performance but with poor or incorrect explinations / justifications.*","block_group":"50aa14f8d99848ee8222e48b132aa056"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"4f98e37a549e47b2b58c99b78c3f0496","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"# References\n\n*Include references if any*","block_group":"a543ce81df1d4d4e902683b1fb792895"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"615724a3c1e54900913f27adb7d3c47e","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Run the following to render to PDF\n!jupyter nbconvert --to pdf project2.ipynb","block_group":"b7f3a93ade1a4126b0a00fc453a5aea7","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=a2a9ec8d-a343-4210-b36b-f9db26268fc5' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote_notebook_id":"d2f25b2b0abf4f65af08d733185ca9f1","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
